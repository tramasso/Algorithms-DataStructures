# C-Programming
There are many codes written in C. From problems with algorithms and graphs to some OpenGL basic examples.

Most codes have Brazilian Portuguese comments and descriptions, they were made while I was still in Brazil. I am working to translate them to make it easier to understand.

Please feel free to ask me questions about the codes, problems or anything that is related at tramasso@hotmail.com.
